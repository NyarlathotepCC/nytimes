WHAT IS THE GOAL:
i want to create a database of all the articles published in the new york times that revolve around a certain topic.
Further I want to add to this database a year-by-year analysis of the emotional tone of the articles.
In short, I want to do a time-series analysis of the nytimes reporting on the topic over the last 170 years with a special focus on 
trends in positive versus negative emotions in the reports.

PLAN:
    -I need
    
        -python code
            -that extracts the articles by means of the nytimes api
            -that inserts the articles in the database
            -that runs the titles and abstracts through the language processing tool (check past pset for nltk)
            -that assigns the individual positive/versus negative word value to each article
            -that inserts the negative and positive word value in the database for each article
            -that depicts the results graphically over time
    
        -1 (or 2?) sql database(s)
            -that store information about the articles/years
                -id, title, year, abstract, positive words in article, negative words in article, maybe author, maybe nytimes section
        
        -output file (format?)
            -that captures the python output in a plot
    
    -TO DO s
    
        -check ny times api manual (check)
        -get api key (check)
        -create empty sql database (check)
        -write python code (TO DO)
        -print out graph (TO DO)
        -analyze and think about results (TO DO)
        -make video for CS50
